## Welcome to Syyam's Portfolio


I am a Computer Science graduate, passionate about Data Science and Machine Learning based research while having experience in mobile application development.

I did my bachelor's in Computer Science from COMSATS University, specializing in AI and Computer Vision. I participated in various competitions and hackathons. I am always on the lookout for new technologies and up for a challenge. My eagerness for learning lead me to publish a research paper in the field of computer vision at BS level and accomplishing other specializations in Machine Learning.

I was passionate about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning since my school days. I love to do computer programming, design, and multi-disciplinary R&D. During my understudy and professional life, I've finished various software development projects related to a wide variety of areas including Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Containerization (Docker), Robotic Process Automation, Human-Computer Interaction, Mobile, and Desktop Software Development.
